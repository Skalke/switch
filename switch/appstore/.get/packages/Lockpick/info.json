  "description": "Nintendo Switch encryption key derivation homebrew",
  "details": "This is a ground-up C++17 rewrite of homebrew key derivation software, namely kezplez-nx. It also dumps titlekeys. This will dump all keys through *_key_05 on firmwares below 6.2.0 and through *_key_06 on 6.2.0 and above.\\n\\nWhat this software does differently\\n\\nDumps titlekeys\\nDumps 6.2.0 keys\\nUses the superfast xxHash instead of sha256 when searching exefs for keys for a ~5x speed improvement\\nGets all possible keys from running process memory - this means no need to decrypt Package2 at all, let alone decompress KIPs\\nGets header_key without tsec, sbk, master_key_00 or aes sources - which may or may not be the same way ChoiDujourNX does it (and I'm gonna issue a challenge to homebrew title installers to implement similar code so you don't need your users to use separate software like this it's up to you to figure out if the same can be done for key_area_keys if needed)\\nUsage\\nUse Hekate v4.5+ to dump TSEC and fuses:\\nPush hekate payload bin using TegraRCMSmash/TegraRCMGUI/modchip/injector\\nUsing the VOL and Power buttons to navigate, select Console info...\\nSelect Print fuse info\\nPress Power to save fuse info to SD card\\nSelect Print TSEC keys\\nPress Power to save TSEC keys to SD card\\nLaunch CFW of choice\\nOpen Homebrew Menu\\nRun Lockpick\\nUse the resulting prod.keys file as needed and rename if required\\nYou may instead use biskeydump and dump to SD to get all keys prior to the 6.2.0 generation - all keys up to those ending in 05. This will dump all keys up to that point regardless which firmware it's run on.\\n\\nNotes\\nTo get keys ending in 06, you must have firmware 6.2.0 installed\\nNo one knows package1_key_06, it's derived and erased fully within the encrypted TSEC payload. While there's a way to extricate tsec_root_key due to the way it's used, this is unfortunately not true of the package1 key\\nIf for some reason you dump TSEC keys on 6.2.0 and not fuses (secure_boot_key) you will still get everything except any of the package1 or keyblob keys (without secure_boot_key, you can't decrypt keyblobs and that's where package1 keys live)",
  "changelog": "v1.1.2\\nDo not overwrite existing keyfile that contains master_key_07\\nRead eticket_rsa_kek from existing keyfile in case user is only running this for titlekeys\\nCreate /switch folder if needed\\n\\nv1.2.1\\n\\nGenerate bis keys without master keys\\nUpdate file size check to support Hekate v4.8 TSEC dump\\nFixed prod.keys alphabetization error\\nFixed build warning for ff.c\\nAdded in-app disclaimer about which keys can be dumped\\n\\n\\nv1.2\\n\\nUpdate for libnx v2.0.0 compatibility and still runs when built with v1.6.0\\nThe binary got even smaller!\\nAccelerate finding FS keys\\nNo longer find BIS sources as they're hardcoded (whoops)\\nFind all keys on first pass hashing FS instead of hashing the whole thing from the beginning repeatedly (whoops)\\n\\nv1.1.1\\n\\nPrevent from trying to dump SD seed and ES keys on 1.0.0 as they're not available until 2.0.0\\n\\nv1.1\\n\\nChanged titlekey dump methodology\\nNo longer crashes sysmodule, reboot no longer needed\\nQueries ES to verify ticket list is accurate\\nMay take slightly longer than before on systems with hundreds of tickets\\nNow dumps SD seed\\nReorganized and clarified UI text\\nNow indicates if no titles are installed to dump titlekeys from\\nSwapped C++ stream functions for C I/O to reclaim some speed and binary size\\nTightened up dependencies\\n\\nv1.0\\n\\nInitial release!"
