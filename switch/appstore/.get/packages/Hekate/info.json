  "details": "Custom Nintendo Switch bootloader, firmware patcher, and more.\\n\\nSupports booting ALL current CFW (1.0.0 - 7.x.x, Linux chainloading and payload tools. No more SD card removals.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\n",
  "changelog": "v4.10.1\\n\\nReverted 204MHz SD device clock\\nSome U1 sd cards with Sandisk microcontroller misbehaved in this speed.\\nSome small QoL changes\\n\\n\\nv4.10\\n\\nFull 8.0.0 support\\nAdd brick protection for RCM patched units\\n(On a patched unit, if you enable RCM, you cause a brick that needs external eMMC programmer to fix.)\\nAdd Exosphere panic report and save to SD\\nUseful to debug those weird colors.\\nAdd status bar update when executing Fix archive bit tools\\nSo you know that you have to wait.\\nFixed a TSEC query timeout for 6.2.0. Thanks @shchmue.\\nAdd support for AutoRCM on devkits\\nBattery \"desync\" fix is now applied on boot\\nBecause of that, the entry in tools got removed.\\nUpdate FatFS to R0.13c (p3)\\nCleaning and refactoring of GFX\\nMany bugfixes\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom secmon and warmboot binary to boot 7.0.0-8\\n\\n\\nv4.9\\n\\nWarning: Because of the new versioning changes, please delete sept/payload.bin.\\n\\nNew in this version\\n\\nSupport for parsing Atmosphere's Fusée Secondary Storage (FFS0)\\nUsing fss0={sd path} allows you to parse kips, exosphere and warmboot from a fusee secondary binary.\\nExosphere and warmboot are overridable if these entries are defined after that.\\nAdditionally any extra kip can be loaded as before via kip1={sd path}/* for many, or kip1={sd path} for a sigle one\\nWarning: Don't double load core kips like loader, pm, sm and ams_mitm. The result will be a hang.\\nSupport for split files restore Thanks to @emvym3two\\nYou can now restore using parts or FAT32. The only condition it that all parts must be in the sd card.\\nIt protects from fake sd cards, bad sectors and frequent I/O corruption. Aka, ~100% of cases.\\nPerformance changes for Backup/Restore/Verification\\nAligned buffers will now up the speeds by a lot.\\nVerfication is now set to Sparse mode by default.\\nIt protects from fake sd cards, bad sectors and frequent I/O corruption. Aka, ~100% of cases.\\nChange order of invoking sept.\\nThis is important, otherwise it can break tools like memloader.\\nUntil a semi-usb init solution is found, hekate will show bootlogo and allow you to go to menu.\\nIf >= 7.0.0 after that, it will run sept and then show logo again without a wait. For as long as rebuilding the boot process takes.\\nSmarter versioning for update.bin and sept payloads\\nNow it supports hotfix versions and it's still compatible with old hekate versions.\\nSept is now updated via hekate's copy in IRAM. This negates the mandatory usage of update.bin and it copies always the most updated version.\\nAdditionally if sept/payload.bin is found that it's foreign, it is renamed and hekate takes its place for running sept. After that it renames the original payload back and continues with booting.\\ndebugmode is now obsolete for atmosphere. It's enabled by default.\\nSome nasty stack corruption bugs were fixed\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\nv4.8\\n\\nFull 7.0.0/7.0.1 support.\\nThe keys are generated via Atmosphère's sept.\\nAdditionally the sept/payload.bin, if found that it is hekate, it gets updated via update.bin.\\nReboot to a selected boot entry via HOS hb\\nYou can now force a boot configuration on hekate by setting the boot storage in the hekate binary.\\nThis can be done via a homebrew, which sets the ini entry that is desired to boot.\\nAdditionally force boot to menu can also be achieved. Please check readme.md for more\\nAuto NoGC\\nIt checks fuses and applies the patch automatically if higher firmware.\\nIt is now a global config and set on auto by default. (0: Disabled, 1: Auto)\\nFixed a bug with ini list, where it would hang when using wildcard * with kip1=.\\nQuality of life fixes under the hood, that ease user's life.\\nAs always many bug fixes and some refactoring.\\nBacklog from v4.6svc beta:\\n\\nsvcControlCodeMemory patches that helps dynarec on emulators.\\nFixed sleep mode with debug mode when official 6.X.X secmon is used\\nAdded RTC driver which now also disables wake up alarm when Auto HOS Power Off is used\\nHelps when users that use AutoRCM inject and power off pretty fast.\\nFixed GPU on Linux when booting from warmboot\\nAdded missing fallback auto calibration of sd cards and plus some small fixes.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nNOTE: You will need sept and a custom warmboot binary to boot 7.X.X.\\n\\nv4.6svc\\n\\nNew in this BETA\\nAdded patch for svcControlCodeMemory that helps dynarec on emulators.\\nFixed sleep mode when debug mode is on and official 6.X.X secmon is used\\nAdded RTC driver which now also disables wake up alarm when Auto HOS Power Off is used\\nHelps when users that use AutoRCM inject and power off pretty fast.\\nFixed GPU on Linux when booting from warmboot\\nAdded missing fallback auto calibration of sd cards and plus some small fixes.\\nNOTE: You can get the other files (lp0 library) from a previous release.\\n\\nv4.6\\n\\nThis version supports booting ALL current OS/CS CFW, Linux chainloading and payload tools.\\nNo more SD card removals\\n\\nLatest OFW supported: 6.2.0\\n\\nNew in this version\\nFixed sleep for downgraded units with efuses burnt more than required.\\nFixed update.bin chainloading and also forced hw init on update, in case it changes again in the future.\\nThis is a breaking fix and requires to have v4.6 to your modchip/dongle.\\nNew archive bit fix\\nIt can now also fix the Nintendo folder. No more \"corrupted\" sd when upgrading sd card or restoring Nintendo folder.\\nFixed UART debug printing. Thanks @hyln9\\nAuto HOS power is now disabled by default. Probably, most people learned what it does and can enable it from the Options menu.\\nSome small SMMU emulation for TSEC fixes for the unluckiest out there. Max wait time remains small.\\nMany many many fixes and also added some error msgs for restore and boot options.\\nNOTE: Everything hekate related, moved to bootloader folder.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nv4.5\\n\\nFull 6.2.0 support. Many thanks to @nwert and @balika011 for their help!\\n-Supports Secure Monitor and new Exosphere\\n-Supports booting 6.2.0 with less than 8 fuses\\n-It has 100% success ratio\\n-Added support to 'Print TSEC keys' and 'Dump pkg1/2' tools\\nFixed YouTube HDCP issue. Thanks @hexkyz for taking the time to investigate.\\nEvery file lister is now ignoring hidden files and .dot files. Thanks @StevenMattera\\nThe Minerva Training Cell library for hekate was updated to latest version (v1.1)\\nAdded \"silent option to Auto HOS power off option. You can now choose if you want the logo to be shown. Thanks @Huntereb\\nRefactored the monolithic main.c to simpler grouped sections. Additionally hos.c took some love.\\nMany many bugfixes\\nNOTE: Everything hekate related, moved to bootloader folder.\\nCheck readme.md for more.\\n\\nv4.2:\\n - Support \"*\" folder wildcard in kip1 key\\n   Using <folder>/* can now parse and load all kip and kip1 files inside that folder.\\n - Add option to enable/disable Auto HOS power off\\n   If you do not use a modchip/dongle, Options->Auto HOS power off to disable.\\n - Allow canceling of the verification process\\n   Now you can cancel backup and verification process. If backup phase is done, canceling in verification, will keep your files.\\n - Some small bugfixes and support certain cfw on its stock version\\n\\nv4.1:\\n - Full 6.0.0 support\\n - Improved .ini/payload handling\\n - PWM backlight\\n - Auto full power off when the device woke up from HOS power off\\n   Usefull with modchips/dongles when using AutoRCM. (You can see it as a breathing backlight with hekate's logo).\\n - Backup can be now cancelled\\n - Bootrom dumping\\n\\nNote: Everything hekate related, moved to bootloader folder."
