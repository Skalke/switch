  "description": "Launches Browser without the need for a DNS",
  "details": "BrowseNX allows you to launch the built-in Switch web browser without needing a DNS. The NRO version currently doesn't allow for html5 video support (just like the DNS) and you have to run it from hbmenu/hbloader that has replaced an app or game, NOT Gallery.\\nThe NSP version available on the github releases is a full browser, including html5 video support.\\n\\nThis also installs https://github.com/p-sam/switch-sys-tweak which disables the supernag, allowing you to access the browser even if you aren't on the latest version.",
  "changelog": "v0.3.1\\n\\nSince the detection for supernag seems to override the sysmodule, now checking if the sysmodule is running and if it is, ignoring the supernag state (this fixes the issue where despite the supernag being patched, BrowseNX would still complain)"
