  "description": "A toolkit and KIP manager for atmosphere",
  "details": "Warning: Do not use the reboot option if your SD card is formatted as exfat.\\n\\nA WIP toolkit for the switch cfw Atmopshere, it started out as a simple KIP manager but has become much more over time. This toolkit is intended for use with Atmosphere Fusee, it will still somewhat work other packs like Kosmos but stuff may be broken.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n - Enabling And Disabling Of KIPS\\n - Configuring BCT.ini\\n - Managing LayeredFS titles\\n - Console reboot (DO NOT USE WITH EXFAT SDCARD)\\n",
  "changelog": "3.0.9\\n\\nFixed incorrectly displayed Atmosphere versions.\\nCenter the detail window header.\\nAdd a size limit to the detail window header so the text doesn't bleed off the screen.\\nRedo error.cpp/h to make adding new errors easier.\\nProperly throw a error if a non 200 HTTP response is received.\\nClarify curl errors.\\nFix reboot to Atmosphere code, it should no longer need to cause a console crash.\\nFixed quite a few spelling errors.\\n\\n3.0.8\\n\\nFixed the serious crashing bug in the short lived 3.0.7 release.\\nUsing some modified code from hactool Kip Select now pulls both the official kip name and titleid from the physical kip file.\\nNSWreleases.xml has been updated to the latest version.\\n\\n3.0.6\\n\\nIn Atmospheres latest release support for rebooting directly into a payload was added. This tool now leverages this in order to (almost) seamlessly restart back into Atmosphere. In the latest Atmosphere release a file called \"/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin\" was added, this file is pretty much a direct copy of fusse_launcher.bin and is necessary for this function to work. After triggering the restart the console will crash, this is normal, press volume up to continue the restart, this seems to be a problem with Atmosphere, as there official example program dose the same thing.\\nIn all Instances where the tool works with the SD card the proper prefix sdmc:/ has been added.\\nCleared up a few error descriptions, i'm probably going to end up completely refactoring this stuff again.\\nSome preparations have been made to support cfw's other than Atmosphere. Renix support should be trivial as it's built pretty much directly off of Atmosphere, keep a eye out for a beta release in the next few days if you are interested.\\n\\n3.0.5\\n\\nLFS now displays the name of most system titles! Atmospheres integrated patches will no longer show up as numbers.\\nFixed odd bug in net code that could have caused a console crash.\\n\\n3.0.4\\n\\nYou can now download a updated NSWreleases.xml from within the tool. This file gets stored on the root of the SD card. If detected at launch the tool will use it instead of the file bundled in its romfs.\\n\\n3.0.3\\n\\nLFS now edits the correct flag, meaning enabling and disabling LFS items should now work properly.\\nThe tool now displays further information about LFS titles, such as there title name, if it can. Currently it dose this by using a bundled NSWreleases.xml, but in the future you will be able to update this file.\\nFixed a bug where if a titleid folder was named in lowercase the console would crash.\\nSome internal fixes to the makefile to make it easier for others to build the project."
